# Synthetic Dataset Generation

> This repository is a modified (and extended) version
> of [debidatta/syndata-generation](https://github.com/debidatta/syndata-generation) and [a-nau/synthetic-dataset-generation](https://github.com/a-nau/synthetic-dataset-generation/actions)
> The augmentation code is not changed. The code was made more modular All credits to the original authors (also see [Citation](#citation)).
